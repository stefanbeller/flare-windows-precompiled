flare-windows-precompiled
=========================

This repository offers precompiled windows binaries for 
http://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine

This will help people, who are not firm in compiling code of their own,
but also want to try out the latest flare engine features.


1.) Get the game data of the game you want to play. (Maybe it is one of the links below:) 

    https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-game/archive/master.zip
    https://github.com/makrohn/polymorphable/archive/master.zip
    https://github.com/makrohn/concordia/archive/master.zip
    
2.) Get the binaries of the flare engine of this repository 

    https://github.com/stefanbeller/flare-windows-precompiled/archive/master.zip
    
3.) After downloading both zip files, extract them into one folder. 
There may be files which exist in both the zip files. 
If unsure prefer the game data files over the engine files.

4.) After unpacking, start flare.exe and have fun.
